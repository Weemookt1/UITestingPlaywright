``markdown # E-commerce Test Automation using Playwright This project demonstrates automated testing of an e-commerce website using Playwright in TypeScript. The test suite covers scenarios like login, product filtering, adding to cart, and completing checkout. ## Prerequisites Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed: - Node.js (v14 or later recommended) - npm (Node Package Manager) - Playwright (`@playwright/test`) ## Installation 1. Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git cd e-commerce-playwright ``` 2. Install dependencies: ```bash npm install ``` ## Configuration Configure Playwright to use your preferred browsers by editing `playwright.config.ts`: ```typescript // playwright.config.ts import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test'; const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = { projects: [ { name: 'Chromium', use: { ...require('playwright').chromium }, }, // Add more browsers if needed (e.g., Firefox, WebKit) ], }; export default config; ``` ## Running Tests Run tests using Playwright's test runner (`@playwright/test`): ```bash # Run tests in all configured browsers npx playwright test # Run tests in a specific browser project (e.g., Chromium) npx playwright test --project=Chromium ``` ## Test Structure - **LoginPage (`loginPage.ts`)**: Contains methods for logging into the website. - **ProductsPage (`productsPage.ts`)**: Methods for filtering products and adding them to the cart. - **CartPage (`cartPage.ts`)**: Methods for proceeding to checkout. - **CheckoutPage (`checkoutPage.ts`)**: Methods for entering shipping details and completing the purchase. ## Writing New Tests To add new tests: 1. Create a new test file (e.g., `newTest.ts`) in the `tests` directory. 2. Use `@playwright/test` and import necessary Page Objects. 3. Write your test cases using `test` and `expect` from Playwright. ## Notes - Adjust CSS selectors and assertions (`expect` statements) based on your application's actual UI. - Ensure your environment variables for credentials or configurations are securely handled (consider using environment files like `.env`). - Extend the Page Object classes (`*.ts`) for more complex scenarios or additional pages. ## Contributing Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting issues or pull requests. Follow the existing coding style and maintain clear commit messages. ## License This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. ``` ### Explanation: - **Prerequisites**: Lists the software needed before running the project. - **Installation**: Steps to clone the repository and install dependencies. - **Configuration**: Instructions to configure Playwright in `playwright.config.ts` for browser settings. - **Running Tests**: Commands to execute tests using Playwright's test runner (`npx playwright test`). - **Test Structure**: Overview of Page Object classes (`loginPage.ts`, `productsPage.ts`, etc.) and their purposes. - **Writing New Tests**: Guidance on how to add new tests to the project. - **Notes**: Additional tips and considerations for maintaining or extending the project. - **Contributing**: Information on how others can contribute to the project. - **License**: Information about the project's licensing terms. ### Additional Tips: - Ensure your README is concise yet informative, catering to both developers familiar with the project and newcomers. - Update the README as the project evolves, especially when adding new features or making significant changes. - Include examples or screenshots if they can help clarify the setup or usage instructions. By providing a comprehensive README file, you make it easier for anyone to understand, use, and contribute to your test automation project using Playwright. Adjust the details and sections as per your project's specific requirements and preferences.
